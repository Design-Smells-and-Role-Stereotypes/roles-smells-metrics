A class or a method only has the number of inner classes that are declared at its level, e.g., an inner class that is declared inside a method M2, that is inside an anonymous class A, that is declared inside a method M, that finally is declared inside a class C, will not count in class C, but only in method M2 (first-level method it is embodied), and anonymous class A (first-level class it is embodied).\",\n",
